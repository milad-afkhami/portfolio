This drove my decision to explore roles outside of large companies, despite receiving satisfying offers.\nAs a result, I joined the Ide-Kavan group, an innovative Iranian startup, where I could challenge myself by leading the rearchitecturing project for their website's front-end, with the aim of achieving long-term sustainability. In my role as a chapter lead, my primary objective was to foster sustainability across the company's projects while also supporting the growth and development of approximately 10 front-end team members.\nBy embracing this new opportunity, I aimed to combine my expertise, creativity, and leadership skills to drive positive change and contribute to the success of the Ide-Kavan group."
