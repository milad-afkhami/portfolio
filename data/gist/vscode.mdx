## 1. Configure snippets

hit `ctrl+shift+p` (⌘ in mac) and write _Configure User Snippets_. Then select **_javascript.json_** and open this file.
Here you can add any snippet that you think will speed up your programming.

These are some of my snippets:

### 1.1 Log With Green Message

prefix: **`logGreen`**

```json
{
  "console.log with green message": {
    "prefix": ["logGreen", "green"],
    "body": "console.log(`%c ${message} \\n`, 'color: green', data);",
    "description": "logging green message to console"
  }
}
```

You can add other colors as well. you just need to replace `green` with desired colors. for example `red`, `yellow` and ...

### 1.2. React Functional Component

prefix: **`!func`**

```json
{
  "React Functional Component": {
    "prefix": "!func",
    "body": "// #region imports\nimport { useState, type FC } from \"react\";\nimport Div from \"@kits/Div\";\nimport Text from \"@kits/Text\";\n// #endregion\n\ninterface ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}Props {\n  example: any;\n}\n\nconst ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}: FC<${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}Props> = (props) => {\n  const {} = props || {};\n  const [state, setState] = useState(null);\n\n  return <Div>${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}</Div>;\n};\n\nexport default ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}};\n",
    "description": "Creates a functional React component"
  }
}
```

- `TM_FILENAME_BASE` is the name of the file that you are using the snippet inside of it.

The above code will generate the below code block:

```jsx
// #region imports
import Div from "@kits/Div";
import Text from "@kits/Text";
import { useState } from "react";
// #endregion

import type { FC } from "react";

interface TM_FILENAME_BASEProps {}

const TM_FILENAME_BASE: FC<TM_FILENAME_BASEProps> = (props) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);

  return <Div>TM_FILENAME_BASE</Div>;
};

export default TM_FILENAME_BASE;
```

[`Div`](/gists/div) and [`Text`](/gists/text) are my most used components so I've added them here, you can replace them with yours most used ones.

### 1.3. Hooks

You may also need to create snippets for your hooks or regular utils. take the `useTranslation` hook from `react-i18next` as example:

```json
{
  "useTranslation hook": {
    "prefix": ["t", "useTranslation", "translation"],
    "body": "const { t } = useTranslation(\"${ns}\");",
    "description": "Invokes useTranslation hook and destructures the t method from it"
  }
}
```

The above snippet will generate the following output:

```javascript
const { t } = useTranslation("ns");
```

## 2. Shortcuts

Hit `ctrl+k ctrl+s` (⌘ in mac) to open up the **Keyboard shortcuts Preferences**,

Alternatively, you can hit `ctrl+shift+p` and write Keyboard shortcuts.

Search Keyboards and click on `+` to set shortcuts.

## Kill Terminal

```javascript
ctrl+k ctrl+t
```

You need to hold `ctrl`, click `k`, and then click `t` without leaving `ctrl`.
