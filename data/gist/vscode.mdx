Hit `ctrl+k ctrl+s` (⌘ in mac) to open up the **Keyboard shortcuts Preferences**,

Alternatively, you can hit `ctrl+shift+p` and write Keyboard shortcuts.

Search Keyboards and click on `+` to set shortcuts.

```javascript
ctrl+k ctrl+t
```

You need to hold `ctrl`, click `k`, and then click `t` without leaving `ctrl`.

## Configure snippets

hit `ctrl+shift+p` (⌘ in mac) and write _Configure User Snippets_. Then select **_javascript.json_** and open this file.
Here you can add any snippet that you think will speed up your programming.

These are some of my snippets:

### 1. Log with green message

Snippet: **`logGreen`**

```javascript
{
  "console.log with green message": {
    "prefix": ["logGreen", "green"],
    "body": "console.log(`%c ${message} \\n`, 'color: green', data);",
    "description": "logging green message to console"
  },
}
```

You can add other colors as well.

### 2. React Functional Component

Snippet: **`!func`**

```javascript
{
  "React Functional Component": {
    "prefix": "!func",
    "body": "// #region imports\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Div, Text } from \"@kits\";\nimport { useState } from \"@hooks\";\n// #endregion\n\nexport default ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}};

const ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}} = (props) => {\n  const {} = props || {};\n  const [state, setState] = useState(null)\n\n  return (\n    <Div>\n      ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}\n    </Div>\n  );\n}\n\n",
    "description": "Creates a functional React component"
  },
}
```

`TM_FILENAME_BASE` is the name of the file you are using snippet inside.
This will generate this code block:

```jsx
// #region imports
import Div from "@kits/Div";
import Text from "@kits/Text";
import { useState } from "react";
// #endregion

export default TM_FILENAME_BASE;

const TM_FILENAME_BASE = (props) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);

  return <Div>TM_FILENAME_BASE</Div>;
};
```

[`Div`](/gists/div) and [`Text`](/gists/text) are my most used components so I've added them here, you can replace them with yours
