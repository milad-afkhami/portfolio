Screw those time consuming intros, let's cut the crap and go straight to the answer.

When it comes to data fetching and server state management, there are so many different approaches to take. some of them are just better approaches but in some cases you gotta just pick the one you like.

Here I want to show you the way I like to implement my projects data-fetching and server state management.

Well tbh most of the times you have to adapt yourself and your approaches to business requirements but there will be always a right way to choose.

## Data fetching strategies in next.js app

### server side rendering

An important point that you should consider is that you are not limited to client-side coding anymore and decisions you make will directly affect your server performance.
My point is that you can use server-side rendering but you should strongly avoid using it until you have to

Most of the time you don't need to show a page full of data to end user immediately.
It has a faster time to load

There is some factors that you need to clarify when it comes to
