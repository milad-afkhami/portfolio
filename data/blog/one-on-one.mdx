If you see the [favourite books page](/favourites/books), you will see one of a book named "The Making of A Manager" by Julie Juoe,
one of the most comprehensive books I've read about management and leadership.

I highly recommend this book to current or future Managers and leaders who want to not only have the title of a manager but also its abilities.

In this post I want to focus on one part of this book which talks about one on one sessions with your reports as a manager.

## 1. One on One Tips

The book offers some tips to help you have a more qualitive one on one sessions with your reports.

### 1.1. Recurrance

She recommends no less than a weekly One-on-one with every report. The duration will depend on the session but at least thirty minutes is required.

### 1.2. Don't Express Your Expectations

These sessions should be focused on your report and what would help him be more successful, not on you and what you expect.

### 1.3. Update Channel

The one on one sessions are about recognizing the obsticles that are in th way of having a good work.
If you're looking for a status update, use another channel.

### 1.4. Aim For Efficiency Not Pleasance

The ideal One-on-one leaves your report feeling that it was useful for them.

If they think that the conversation was pleasant but largely unmemorable, then you can do better.

### 1.5. Discuss Top Priorities

You want your time together to be valuable, so you should focus on what's most important for them.

Ask your report what are the one, two, or three most critical outcomes for them report and how can you help them tackle those challenges.

### 1.6. Calibrate The "Great"

As a team, you should have a shared vision of what you're working toward and be in sync about goals and expectations.

### 1.7. Share Feedback

Share feedbacks that will help your report.

Ask your report for feedbacks that will make you more effective as a manager

### 1.8. How Is Everythig?

Once in a while, it's useful to zoom out and talk about your report's general state of mind

Ask about how is he feeling on the whole? What's making him satisfied or dissatisfied? Have any of his goals changed? What has he learned recently and what does he want to learn going forward?

### 1.9. [Extra] Remember Your Vision

Remember and review your vision. You need an ambitious, concrete, and specific vision for your team. If you ask 5 random people who have heard your vision to repeat it, would they be able to?

## 2. Questions For One-On-Ones

### 2.1. Identify:

- What's top of mind for you right now?
- What priorities are you thinking about this week?
- What's the best use of our time today?

### 2.2. Understand:

- What does your ideal outcome look like?
- What's hard for you in getting to that outcome?
- What do you really care about?
- What do you think is the best course of action? What's the worst-case scenario you're worried about?

### 2.3. Support:

- How can I help you?
- What can I do to make you more successful?
- What was the most useful part of our conversation today?

## 3. Gather data from sessions

Let's imagine that you do everthing well. You still need to remember things and act upon them in the future.
so you have to note the spicific things in your one-on-one sessions with team members.

### 3.1. Why Noting Matters?

### 3.1.1. Decision Making

Noting specific things will give you more data to decide based on them when you have couple of choices to make and you are stuck.

### 3.1.2. Intercommunication

You are a team, there are so many things that will affect the performance and emotions of eachother.
So there are situations that you hear multiple things from different people, it's important to hear 3. from different point of views

### 3.1.3. Supervision Circles
