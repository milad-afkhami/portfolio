Complexity and other downsides of redux as mentioned [here](/blog/rethink-using-redux) are the reasons that there are so many projects with bad redux structure and hard to maintain codes.
In this blog, I want to show you the way I like to implement projects with redux.

Before choosing redux for state management, please consider reading the [Why Do You Need to Rethink About Using Redux](/blog/rethink-using-redux) blog first. If you still want to use redux for your next project, keep on reading the rest of this blog.

Here I work on a next.js project, if you have a react project you can skip next.js parts, and I use [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) as an async middleware to handle side effects.

## 0. Demo & Source Code

I've created a github repository for sharing this boilerplate with you, you can access it here: [Source](https://github.com/miladMAPS/redux-clean-code-boilerplate)

And there is a [demo here](https://redux-clean-code-boilerplate-mili.vercel.app/) deployed with [vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## 1. Installing libraries

First, install needed packages:

```cmd
yarn add redux react-redux redux-saga next-redux-wrapper redux-devtools-extension
```

## 2. Folder structure

I like to have a redux folder to put all of the redux mess inside of it, and inside of that another two folders, `middleware` for all my middlewares and `modules` for all saga workers.

<Div width="600px" height="300px" Mw="100%" position="relative" mx="auto">
  <Image
    src="/images/blog/redux-folder-structure.png"
    layout="fill"
    fit="contain"
  />
</Div>

## 3. Middlewares

Middlewares in redux play a huge role, we can use them for logging, error handling, reporting, and ...
The only required middleware here is saga middleware, we need to create a `middleware/saga.js` file like this:

```javascript
import createSagaMiddleware from "redux-saga";

export const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
```

## 4. Walkthrough root files

In the root of the redux folder, we have 5 files.

**handleSagaError**
This is file is for handling different errors. It contains a generator function:

```javascript
import { put, delay } from "redux-saga/effects";

export default function* handleSagaError(error, status = "failure") {
  if (error.type === "serverError") {
    yield put(alert("layout.alert.error.server"));
    yield delay(6000);
    return;
  }

  if (error.type === "internet") {
    yield put(alert("layout.alert.error.connection"));
    yield delay(6000);
    return;
  }

  if (error.type >= 500) {
    yield put(alert("layout.alert.error.server"));
    yield delay(6000);
  }

  // ...
}
// some function for showing notifications
function alert() {}
```

**index.js**
This file is for combining and exporting modules so outer modules won't have to now our folder structure to import :

```javascript
import { END } from "redux-saga";

export * from "./modules/rehydrate";
export * from "./modules/language";
// export * from "./modules/...";

export const SAGA_END = END;
export const APP_HYDRATION = "APP_HYDRATION";
```

**reducers.js**
This file is responsible for bringing all of our reducers together, ready to combine with combineReducer.

```javascript
import { xxxKey, xxxReducer } from "./modules/xxx";

export const reducers = {
  [xxxKey]: xxxReducer,
};
```

**sagas.js**
This file is responsible for creating our sagas
Here we don't have many sagas so I only have a root saga, but as the number of your sagas increases, you need to separate them into multiple sagas.

```javascript
import { all, takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects";
import {
  APP_HYDRATION,
  //
  REHYDRATE,
  rehydrateWorker,
  //
  languageActionTypes,
  changeLanguageWorker,
  //
  xxxActionTypes,
  xxxWorker,
} from "./";

export function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([
    takeEvery(APP_HYDRATION, rehydrateWorker),
    takeEvery(languageActionTypes.CHANGE_LANGUAGE, changeLanguageWorker),
    takeEvery(xxxActionTypes.TRIGGER, xxxWorker),
    takeEvery(artistActionTypes.TRIGGER, artistWorker),
  ]);
}
```

**store.js**
And most important file is store.js which is for configuring our store.

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";
import createSagaMiddleware from "redux-saga";
import { createWrapper, HYDRATE } from "next-redux-wrapper";
import { APP_HYDRATION } from "@redux";
import { rootSaga } from "./sagas";
import { reducers } from "./reducers";

const bindMiddleware = (middleware) => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
    const { composeWithDevTools } = require("redux-devtools-extension");
    return composeWithDevTools({ trace: true })(applyMiddleware(...middleware));
  }
  return applyMiddleware(...middleware);
};

const rootReducer = (state, action) =>
  action.type === HYDRATE
    ? { ...state, ...action.payload }
    : combineReducers(reducers)(state, action);

const makeStore = (context) => {
  const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
  const store = createStore(rootReducer, bindMiddleware([sagaMiddleware]));
  store.sagaTask = sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);
  if (process.browser) store.dispatch({ type: APP_HYDRATION });
  return store;
};

const nextReduxWrapper = createWrapper(makeStore, {
  debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
});

export { makeStore, nextReduxWrapper };
```

All `store.js` files are pretty much the same, here we are doing some different things:

- `rootReducer` function separates `HYDRATE` action from others and combines reducers.
- `bindMiddleware` handles setting up [redux-devtools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-devtools-extension) in development mode.
- `makeStore` function makes store! it creates a store, runs the rootSaga and if we are on the client-side it dispatches the `APP_HYDRATION` action.
- `nextReduxWrapper` is a wrapper we'll need in **\_app.js** and all files that their data fetching method needs to access redux

## 5. Creating modules/workers

With [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/), every worker is a generator function, We will create our actions and workers in the same file and every reducer has 5 different types of action:

- `TRIGGER`: We will deal with this action in components.
- `REQUEST`: After triggering the TRIGGER action type, REQUEST will get dispatched and it's a sign for us to trigger loading and loaded properties of our state
- `SUCCESS`: After triggering the REQUEST action type, if everything went well, the SUCCESS action type will get fired and we will set the data property of our state
- `FAILURE`: After triggering the REQUEST action type, if anything went wrong, the FAILURE action type will get fired and we will set the error property of our state
- `FULFILL`: After all of the processes got finished, this action type will get fired and we will reset the loading and loaded state of our state

Soon in redux, you will find out so much of your code is just repeating yourself. so we need a way to prevent it. We need a method that takes store names and generates all actions types and required reducers for us.
I created that method and called it `ReduxRoutines` like this:

```javascript
const REDUX_ACTION_TYPES = [
  "TRIGGER",
  "REQUEST",
  "SUCCESS",
  "FAILURE",
  "FULFILL",
  "RESET",
];
```

```javascript
import { REDUX_ACTION_TYPES } from "@constants";

const initialState = {
  timestamp: null, // timestamp of the last action that was dispatched
  data: null,
  error: null,
  loading: false,
  loaded: false, // has data been fulfilled successfully?
  triggerPayload: null, // the payload that reducer got triggered with
};

export function ReduxRoutines(key) {
  const sagaRoutines = createSagaRoutines(key);
  this.actions = sagaRoutines.actions;
  this.actionTypes = sagaRoutines.actionTypes;

  this.reducer = (state, action) =>
    createReducer(state, action, this.actionTypes);
}

function createSagaRoutines(key) {
  return REDUX_ACTION_TYPES.reduce(
    (acc, cv) => {
      // actionTypes = { TRIGGER: `${key}/TRIGGER`, REQUEST: `${key}/REQUEST`, ... }
      acc.actionTypes[cv] = `${key}/${cv}`;

      // actions = { trigger: (payload = {}) => ({ type: actionTypes.TRIGGER, payload }), ... }
      acc.actions[cv.toLowerCase()] = (payload = {}) => ({
        type: acc.actionTypes[cv],
        payload,
      });

      return acc;
    },
    { actions: {}, actionTypes: {} }
  );
}

function createReducer(state = initialState, action, actionTypes) {
  const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
  switch (action.type) {
    case actionTypes.TRIGGER:
      return {
        ...state,
        timestamp,
        triggerPayload: action.payload || null,
        loading: true,
      };
    case actionTypes.REQUEST:
      return {
        ...state,
        timestamp,
      };
    case actionTypes.SUCCESS:
      return {
        ...state,
        timestamp,
        data: action.payload,
        error: null,
      };
    case actionTypes.FAILURE:
      return {
        ...state,
        timestamp,
        // data: null,
        error: action.payload,
      };
    case actionTypes.FULFILL:
      return {
        ...state,
        timestamp,
        loading: false,
        loaded: true,
      };
    case actionTypes.RESET:
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

## 6. Usage

In **\_app.js** file, you need to wrap the App component in `nextReduxWrapper.withRedux` like this:

```javascript
export default nextReduxWrapper.withRedux(WrappedApp);
```

And wherever in files inside pages directory you wanted to use data fetching methods of next.js, you need to import `nextReduxWrapper` and use it like this:

```javascript
import { nextReduxWrapper } from "@redux";

export default function () {
  // ...
}

export const getStaticProps = nextReduxWrapper.getStaticProps(
  (store) => () => {}
);
```

Finally, you need to create a worker for every slice of your store.
In [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) a worker is a generator function like this:

```javascript
import { call, put } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { ReduxRoutines } from "@models";
import { Http, __get } from "@utils";
import handleSagaError from "@redux/handleSagaError";
import { endpoints } from "@constants";

const key = "home";

const { actions, actionTypes, reducer } = new ReduxRoutines(key);

export function* homeWorker(action) {
  const { type, payload } = action;
  try {
    yield put(actions.request());
    const response = yield call(Http.get, { url: endpoints[key] });
    const result = response?.result?.explore?.items || [];
    yield put(actions.success(result));
    action?.payload?.resolve?.(result);
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(actions.failure(error));
    yield handleSagaError(error);
    action?.payload?.reject?.(error);
  } finally {
    yield put(actions.fulfill());
  }
}

export {
  actions as homeActions,
  actionTypes as homeActionTypes,
  reducer as homeReducer,
  key as homeKey,
};
```

## Conclusion

As I mentioned, there is another blog [here](/blog/rethink-using-redux) that describes why do you need to be precise about using redux in your projects, but if you figured out that using redux will be appropriate for your development process, this is the best way I know to implement redux.

There are some other tools like [redux toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit) to help us write more understandable and clean redux code that you can use if you prefer.
