If you have worked on some react based projects, you know that most of people are using **redux** for handling server state management or even UI and form state management.
This is so common that using it is like a decisive convention and developers don't consider alternatives solutions.

## 1. Redux downsides

IMO, choosing redux for handling server state management should be done obsessively for below reasons.

### 1.1. Complexity

Writing <abbr title="Don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr>, <abbr title="single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle and dependency inversion principle">SOLID</abbr> redux code is god's work, most of the approaches you take, may have problems in their implementation and that's because redux code is complex and it doesn't worth it's difficulty unless it's necessary.

### 1.2. Unopinionated

As it is mentioned in [redux official documentation](https://redux.js.org/redux-toolkit/overview#purpose):

> The Redux core library is deliberately unopinionated. It lets you decide how you want to handle anything, including store setup, what your state contains, and how you want to build your reducers.

This is a good thing sometimes, because it gives you flexibility but that's not the point here. The point here is because of that, there is so many ways to set up redux implementation, so whenever you work on a project there is a strong chance you won't be able to understand what is going on in the code for a while.
Add using different async middlewares like [redux saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/), [redux thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk), [redux observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) or ... as multipliers to this problems.
Ofcourse there is some packages to fix this issue like [redux toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit) but not everyone use it.

### 1.3 Hard to maintain

If you use redux to develop your application, even small changes in functionality require you to write excessive amounts of code. You either ought to do it or violate principles of clean coding (if there is anything left).

### 1.4 Better alternatives

DESCRIPTION

## 2. When to use redux

If you don't trust me lets take a look at [redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/faq/general#when-should-i-use-redux) itself:

> Redux is most useful when in cases when:
>
> - You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
>
> - The app state is updated frequently
>
> - The logic to update that state may be complex
>
> - The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people
>
> - You need to see how that state is being updated over time

- Are so many of your states needed in more than one places in your app?
- Does these states changes frequently?

If your answer to all those questions is yes, you can use redux, see [how to write redux clean code](https://portfolio-mili.vercel.app/blog/redux-clean-code), but otherwise I can't see a reason why.

## 3. alternatives

There are some alternatives to redux. any of them have their own downsides and benefits we will discuss about.

### 3.1 Context API

You probably already know about Context API, on first glance it looks like a great first party way to handle server state management but it is not. It wasn't meant to be like that but with combination to react hooks, we can use it as a global state managing tool.
The biggest reason it shouldn't be your first option is that it doesn't use smart memoization and a trigger in it's state will update entire components tree.

Changes in a part of state will trigger rerender to all the subscriptions(with useContext), this issue is fixed in redux when we use useSelector to subscribe to a certain slice of an state. but it's still [an ongoing process for react](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119).
But until react releases **_`useSelectedContext`_** hook, we can use [use-context-selector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-context-selector) library to subscribe to a certain slice of context. and prevent unnecessary rerenders and performance leaks.

You can use Context Api for handling ui state and server states that doesn't change frequently but I think it's better to consider other alternatives.

### 3.2 SWR | React query

SWR and react query are new ways to handle state management and other interesting stuffs.
I think both of them are great alternatives and endgames.
There is a table from [react query documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/comparison) that will help you to choose one over the other.

I've used both of them and SWR more.
[Here](http://localhost:4000/blog/data-fetching-pattern-preference) in 5th section I described the way I like to implement custom hooks with useSWR.
