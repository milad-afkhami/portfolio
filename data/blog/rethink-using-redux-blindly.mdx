In this post I want to tell you how not to be a jackass about <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, ...">LGBT+</abbr> family.

First of all, it is 21st century fellows, the least thing you can do for people who are under a lot of pressure is not to be a jackass about them. It's anyone's right to choose the way they want to live weather it is something they born with or something that they became over time.
Your responsibility as part of society you live in is to respect the differences weather you like them or not.
there is no idea that worth shit to force people to believe in it.
Bad culture and hyper religious people are making it hard enough for people to live their one and only lfe by the opinions they believe in, so please be different and rational about behaviours that will maybe ruin some peoples life

If you just can do that, this is the part you can leave, but if you want to know more about something you probably will face in work, family or any other groups please consider reading the rest of this post.

## what does the term <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, ...">**LGBT**</abbr> mean ?

The term LGBT technically stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender. It includes both sexual orientation (LGB) and gender identity
(T). Below, we break down a few basic terms and concepts. These are just some
of the many terms that are used to define sexual orientation, as well as
gender identity and expression. A word of caution: Be careful not to impose
any of these terms onto others. Let others identify themselves in ways that
make them feel safe and authentic to their true selves.

Let's start with basics.

- Basics
  - **Sex** : Genetic and physical body characteristics people are born with, labeled male or female.
  - **Gender** : A social and cultural expression of sex; not the biological sex people are born with.
  - **Intersex** : People who are born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit typical definitions of **male** or **female**.
  - **Gender Identity** : An internal feeling of being male, female, or something else.
  - **Gender Expression** : Ways of showing gender to others, such as through mannerisms, clothes, and personal interests.
  - **Questioning** : Individuals who are unsure about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
- Sexual orientation
  - **Lesbian | Gay** : Individuals who are romantically, emotionally, and/or sexually attracted to the same sex/gender.
  - **Bisexual** : Individuals who are romantically, emotionally, and/or sexually attracted to multiple sexes/genders.
- Gender identity and expression
  - **Cisgender** : Individuals whose gender identity/expressions is similar to that typically associated with their assigned sex at birth.
  - **Transgender** : Individuals whose gender identity/expression is different from that typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Make sure to use the correct pronouns for them (he/him for masculines and she/her for feminine ones )
  - **Bigender** : A person who fluctuates between traditionally “male” and “female” gender-based behaviours and identities.
  - **Agender | Non-binary | Gender Neutral** : Not having a gender or identifying with a gender. They may describe themselves as being gender neutral or genderless. the correct pronouns to refer to them is they/them as gender neutral pronouns or ze/hir as a more precise way.
  - **Gender Fluid** : A mix of boy and girl. A person who is gender fluid may always feel like a mix of the two traditional genders, but may feel more man some days, and more woman other days.
  - **...**

## Why is it important to respect people’s pronouns?

You can’t always know what someone’s pronouns are by looking at them. Asking and correctly using someone’s pronouns is one of the most basic ways to show your respect for their gender identity.

When someone is referred to with the wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated, dismissed, alienated, or dysphoric ( often all of the above.)

It is very important to respect peoples differences and also to know them in the way they want, not the way the others thrust to them.

## Want to be an ally to these people ?

Anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, can support lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Deepening your understanding of LGBT-related issues, can help you support LGBT-identified people.
