In this post I want to tell you how not to be a jackass about <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, ...">LGBT+</abbr> community.

First of all, it is 21st century fellows, the least thing you can do for people who are under a lot of pressure is not to be a jackass about them. It's anyone's right to choose the way they want to live weather it is something they born with or something that they became over time.
Your responsibility as part of society you live in is to respect the differences weather you like them or not.
There is no ideology that worth shit to force people to believe in it.
Bad culture and hyper religious people are making it hard enough for people to live their one and only life the way they prefer, so please be rational and a little more strict about behaviours that will maybe ruin peoples lives.

If you just can do that, this is the part you can leave, but if you want to know more about something you probably will face in work, family or any other groups please consider reading the rest of this post.

## What does the term <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, ...">**LGBT+**</abbr> mean ?

The term LGBT technically stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender. It includes both sexual orientation (LGB) and gender identity
(T). Below, we break down a few basic terms and concepts. These are just some
of the many terms that are used to define sexual orientation, as well as
gender identity and expression. A word of caution: Be careful not to impose
any of these terms onto others. Let others identify themselves in ways that
make them feel safe and authentic to their true selves.

## Why is it important to respect people’s pronouns?

You can’t always know what someone’s pronouns are by looking at them. Asking and correctly using someone’s pronouns is one of the most basic ways to show your respect for their gender identity.

When someone is referred to with the wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated, dismissed, alienated, or dysphoric ( often all of the above.)

It is very important to respect peoples differences and also to know them in the way they want, not the way the others thrust to them.

## Want to be an ally to these people ?

Anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, can support lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Deepening your understanding of LGBT-related issues, can help you support LGBT-identified people.
