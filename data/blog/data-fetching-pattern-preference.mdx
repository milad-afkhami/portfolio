Screw those time consuming intros, let's cut the crap and go straight to the answer.

When it comes to data fetching and server state management, there are so many different approaches to take. some of them are just better approaches but in some cases you gotta just pick the one you like.

Here I want to show you the way I like to implement my projects data-fetching and server state management.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) has some interesting approaches, I consider that you already know what they offer.

Well tbh most of the times you have to adapt yourself and your approaches to business requirements but there will be always a right way to choose.

## Data fetching strategies in next.js app

### server side rendering

An important point that you should consider is that you are not limited to client-side coding anymore and decisions you make will directly affect your server performance.
My point is that you can use server-side rendering but you should strongly avoid using it until you have to

- some of the downsides of server side rendering are:
  - Much more <abbr title="first contentful paint">FCP</abbr>
  - So many pressure on server to render the page everytime a user visits
  - More <abbr title="time to interactive">TTI</abbr> which isn't a good thing for end users.
  - ...

### client side rendering

A lot of programmers when the write <abbr title="server side rendering">SSR</abbr> applications, forget that they have another options to call API's which is client side data fetching.
Most of the time you don't need to show a page full of data to end user immediately.
Client side rendering has a faster time to first byte and only when you are dealing with SEO you have to somehow prepare content in first load. but there is no force for render other pages on server-side when you can very soon show a nice animated skeleton loading on first load and then fetch page data on client side. will it be a bad practice for SEO? ofcourse not, why should google robots give a shit about your homepage content.

There is only one factor that you need to clarify when to choose using client side data fetching
`Does SEO matters for this page?`

Only if there is some content in this page that you have to generate serve immediately on client you should avoid using client side data fetching
for example if this is a product page that contains useful data for crawlers, or it is a blog page, faq page and ...
otherwise you don't have to use any kind of server side rendering and decrease a huge amount of load on your servers.
