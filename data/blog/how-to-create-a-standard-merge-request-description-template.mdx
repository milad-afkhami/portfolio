## Introduction

The merge request process is a critical aspect of collaborative software development. To standardize and streamline this process, it's essential to have a clear and comprehensive merge request description template. In this blog post, we will guide you on how to create and implement a standard merge request description template, ensuring that your team follows a consistent and efficient workflow.

## Setting Up the Default Description Template

The first step is to insert the following code into the default description template settings for merge requests in your repository.

```md
## Related Issue

Resolves #ISSUE-IDENTIFIER[S]

## Changes

_A summary of changes that this merge request contains. By default, it's a list of its commits._

%{all_commits}

## Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] This merge request follows [the standard style guides](LINK_TO_STYLE_GUIDE_DOCUMENTATION).

- [ ] I have assigned the correct reviewer(s) to this merge request.
- [ ] I have added the suitable label(s) corresponding to this merge request.
- [ ] If there are other merge requests related or dependent on this one, I have mentioned them in the `dependencies` section.
- [ ] I have added the **Draft** prefix if I don't want this merge request to be merged yet.
- [ ] I have added the **WIP** prefix if I don't want this merge request to be reviewed yet, and therefore I haven't added any reviewers or assignees.
- [ ] I have attached the Figma design or, at the very least, a screenshot (if available) that pictures the intended output of this merge request to the issue details or in [the Additional Notes section](#additional-notes).

### Checklist

While submitting a merge request, check all checklist items accurately; otherwise, reviewers won't review/approve/merge your merge request.

### Review The Changes

Review the options whenever you push changes to the merge request.

### Understanding Labels

Labels play a crucial role in organizing work and tracking issues and merge requests. Here are some commonly used labels:

- bug: Indicates a bug fix.
- critical: Indicates a critical bug fix (hotfix).
- documentation: Indicates adding or improving documentation.
- enhancement: Indicates an enhancement to the codebase.
- feature: Indicates a new feature.
- refactor: Indicates a refactor or clean-up.
- test: Indicates a test.
- help wanted: Indicates a need for guidance.
- need more info: Indicates that the merge reviewers need more information, and the standards of the current chapter are not provided.
- duplicate: Indicates that a similar merge request already exists.

## Conclusion

Implementing a standard merge request description template and utilizing labels are crucial steps toward maintaining an organized and efficient development workflow. By following these practices, your team can ensure transparency, collaboration, and high-quality code contributions.
