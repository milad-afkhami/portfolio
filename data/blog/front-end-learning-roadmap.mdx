## Understanding the Order:

To ensure a structured learning path, the roadmap employs visual cues
using dashed borders and areas to indicate the order of grouped concepts.

- <span style={{ color: "red" }}>Red</span> area & border: High Priority Topics

  - Topics outlined with a red border are of high priority. It is recommended to
    focus on these topics first as they form the foundation of your learning journey.

- <span style={{ color: "yellow" }}>Yellow</span> area & border: Normal Priority
  Topics

  - Topics outlined with a yellow border are considered of normal priority.
    Once you have completed all the high priority topics, you can begin exploring these
    concepts.

- <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>Blue</span> area & border: Low Priority Topics

  - Topics outlined with a blue border are of low priority. It is advised to start
    working on these concepts only after you have finished all the high and normal
    priority topics.
