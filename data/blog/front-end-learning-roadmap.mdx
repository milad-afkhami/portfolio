## Description

This roadmap which you can download in [this github repository](https://github.com/milad-afkhami/front-end-learning-roadmap), is(I.M.O.) the roadmap to become a senior front-end developer.

You need the [XMind app](https://xmind.app/download/) installed in order to open this file.

I may have dropped some tools somewhere so feel free to mention missing items in [the issues section](https://github.com/milad-afkhami/front-end-learning-roadmap/issues).
