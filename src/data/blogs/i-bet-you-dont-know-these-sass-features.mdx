## Introduction

Sass has amazing features that often go unnoticed, although we can make amazing stuff with them in a performant way. Features like `@for` loops, `@while` loops, `@forEach` loop, and conditional rendering using `@if`/`@else` syntax, are Sass flow control at-rules and along with _arrays_/_tuples_ and objects, are there to help us be creative and make stuff in an efficient manner.
This blog will take you on a step-by-step journey to dynamically generate CSS utility classes using Sass. Even if you're not currently using Sass, this guide might make you have second thoughts!

## CSS Color Utility Classes

Start by defining an object of available colors:

```scss
$bg-colors: (
  primary: /* PRIMARY BG COLOR VALUE */,
  secondary: /* SECONDARY BG COLOR VALUE */,
  success: /* ASSISTIVE SUCCESS COLOR VALUE */,
  error: /* ASSISTIVE ERROR COLOR VALUE */,
  warning: /* ASSISTIVE WARNING COLOR VALUE */,
  info: /* ASSISTIVE INFO COLOR VALUE */,
);
```

and unleashing Sass hidden powers:

```scss
@each $key, $value in $bg-colors {
  .bg-#{$key} {
    background-color: $value;
  }
}
```

This will eventually lead to `.bg-brand`, `.bg-primary`, `.bg-secondary`, `.bg-success`, etc. This intuitive syntax uses [the `@each` at-rule from Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/each/) similar to JavaScript's `Object.entries` method, dynamically generates CSS utility classes for background colors, opening up possibilities for other color-related objects like `text-colors` and `border-colors`.

## CSS Font Utility Classes

Similar to our approach with colors, we can repeat the process for typography and font sizes. All that's required is defining the typography object:

```scss
$font-sizes: (
  lg: 0.25rem,
  md: 0rem,
  sm: -0.25rem,
);
```

and utilizing the Sass powers:

```scss
@each $size, $value in $font-sizes {
  .font-#{$size} {
    font-size: 1rem + $value;
  }
}
```

This will eventually lead to `.font-sm`, `.font-md`, and `.font-lg`. Similar to colors, you can scale the typography object providing flexibility in design.

## CSS Flex Utility Classes

We can even have nested loops in Sass 😯! Given below objects:

```scss
$flex-align-values: (
  center: center,
  end: flex-end,
  start: flex-start,
);
$flex-justify-values: (
  center: center,
  end: flex-end,
  start: flex-start,
  around: space-around,
  between: space-between,
);
```

Then we can write a nested loop to generate flex utility classes:

```scss
@each $align, $align-value in $flex-align-values {
  .flex-#{$align} {
    display: flex;
    align-items: $align-value;
    @each $justify, $justify-value in $flex-justify-values {
      &-#{$justify} {
        /* the & sign is for appending to previous result(.flex-#{$align}) */
        display: flex;
        align-items: $align-value;
        justify-content: $justify-value;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will eventually lead to something like `flex-[center, end, start]` and `flex-[center, end, start]-[center, end, start, around, between]`. e.g. `flex-center`, `flex-center-center`, `flex-start-between` etc.

## Other CSS Utility Classes

Empowered by the knowledge gained in this blog, the possibilities extend to generating various other CSS utility classes. From `border` and `border-radius` to `position` and `display` utility classes, Sass empowers you to simplify your code and enhance your development workflow.

## Conclusion

Utilize the hidden potential of Sass features beyond the basics. With dynamic class generation, you can efficiently manage colors, typography, flex layouts, and more. While the each at-rule was enough for the examples in this blog, you can explore other possibilities with Sass by utilizing [the for at-rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for/), [the while at-rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/while/), and [the if/else at-rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/). Elevate your coding experience and unlock new creative possibilities by diving into the advanced features of Sass.
