# Introduction

Feedback is the lifeblood of any thriving team. It's how we grow, innovate, and collaborate effectively. But let's face it: feedback can be tricky. Unstructured or poorly delivered feedback can lead to confusion, resentment, and missed opportunities. That's why professionals rely on structured feedback models to keep communications clear, actionable, and effective.

In this guide, we'll explore five practical feedback models—**SBI**, **COIN**, **BOOST**, **AID**, and **STAR**. You'll learn how to apply each with clarity and confidence, along with visual diagrams and practical examples.

Let's dive in!

## 1. <abbr title="Situation-Behavior-Impact">SBI</abbr> (Situation-Behavior-Impact)

**Overview:**
The SBI model is simple, powerful, and effective. It anchors feedback to specific situations, making the message clear and objective.

**Components:**

- **Situation:** Clearly describe the specific situation.
- **Behavior:** Focus on observable behaviors (not intentions).
- **Impact:** Highlight the impact this behavior had on you, the team, or the organization.

**Example:**

> "In yesterday's team meeting (**Situation**), I noticed you interrupted Sara multiple times (**Behavior**). This made her withdraw from sharing her valuable insights (**Impact**)."

**Best Use Cases:** Immediate, specific feedback—especially useful in peer-to-peer scenarios.

## 2. <abbr title="Context-Observation-Impact-Next Steps">COIN</abbr> (Context-Observation-Impact-Next Steps)

**Overview:**
COIN adds a future-oriented element to feedback, emphasizing actionable steps after discussing context and observations.

**Components:**

- **Context:** Explain the context clearly.
- **Observation:** State what you've observed objectively.
- **Impact:** Articulate the result or impact.
- **Next Steps:** Suggest clear actions or improvements.

**Example:**

> "During the client presentation (**Context**), I noticed some key metrics were missing (**Observation**), which led to client confusion (**Impact**). Next time, let's double-check the data together beforehand (**Next Steps**)."

**Best Use Cases:** Performance reviews, structured 1:1 feedback sessions.

## 3. <abbr title="Balanced-Observed-Objective-Specific-Timely">BOOST</abbr> (Balanced-Observed-Objective-Specific-Timely)

**Overview:**
BOOST helps deliver balanced feedback that’s fair, specific, and timely, making it easier to accept and act upon.

**Components:**

- **Balanced:** Provide both positive and constructive points.
- **Observed:** Stick to observed facts.
- **Objective:** Remain unbiased and factual.
- **Specific:** Be precise about details.
- **Timely:** Give feedback promptly.

**Example:**

> "You did a great job handling customer queries (**Balanced, Observed**), but I noticed response times slipped in the afternoon (**Specific, Objective**). Let's review workload distribution this week (**Timely**)."

**Best Use Cases:** Regular team check-ins, balanced and ongoing performance feedback.

## 4. <abbr title="Action-Impact-Desired Outcome">AID</abbr> (Action-Impact-Desired Outcome)

**Overview:**
AID provides concise feedback focusing quickly on actions, consequences, and desired outcomes—ideal for fast-paced environments.

**Components:**

- **Action:** Clearly outline the action.
- **Impact:** Explain the impact.
- **Desired Outcome:** Clarify what behavior or result is desired.

**Example:**

> "Your detailed project update (**Action**) significantly clarified our goals (**Impact**). Continue this approach to keep the team aligned (**Desired Outcome**)."

**Best Use Cases:** Quick, actionable feedback, ideal for agile environments.

## 5. <abbr title="Situation-Task-Action-Result">STAR</abbr> (Situation-Task-Action-Result)

**Overview:**
STAR is widely used for structured feedback and performance evaluations, giving a comprehensive view of actions and outcomes.

**Components:**

- **Situation:** Set the stage by describing the situation.
- **Task:** Outline the task or role.
- **Action:** Describe specific actions taken.
- **Result:** Discuss the outcomes or results.

**Example:**

> "When we faced tight deadlines last month (**Situation**), you coordinated cross-team meetings (**Task**) by initiating daily standups (**Action**), which helped us deliver on time (**Result**)."

**Best Use Cases:** Structured performance reviews, interviews, in-depth feedback sessions.
