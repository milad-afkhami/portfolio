## Why Another Code Review System?

Code review is where engineering ideals go to either mature—or rot politely.

Most review tools fail in one of two ways:

- they are **too shallow** (“LGTM 👍”), or
- they are **too noisy**, dumping generic lint wisdom with no sense of project context.

Claude Code’s review commands take a different route:  
they split responsibility across **specialized, opinionated agents**, each with a sharply defined role, shared standards, and zero tolerance for vague feedback.

Collectively, they’re known (affectionately, and a bit dangerously) as **The Sissies**.

## The Big Idea: Specialized Review Agents

Instead of one omniscient reviewer pretending to be good at everything, Claude Code runs **parallel reviewers**, each focused on a single dimension of quality:

- accessibility
- security
- performance
- SEO
- styling
- code quality
- React patterns
- TypeScript safety
- git hygiene
- QA & requirements

Each agent:

- follows the **same commenting contract**
- uses consistent severity levels
- posts **actionable GitLab threads**
- ends with a **summary verdict**

Let’s meet them.

---

## 🦯 Colorblind Sissy — Accessibility

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/colorblind-sissy.jpg" alt="Colorblind Sissy" />

Accessibility reviews are usually an afterthought. This agent treats them as **blocking engineering requirements**.

Focus areas:

- semantic HTML
- keyboard navigation
- ARIA correctness (and restraint)
- WCAG A / AA compliance
- reduced motion and focus visibility

If something is inaccessible, it’s not “nice to have.”  
It’s a ❗ **must-fix**.

---

## 🔒 SecuSissy — Security

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/secu-sissy.jpg" alt="SecuSissy" />

This agent assumes attackers are clever, bored, and motivated.

It looks for:

- XSS and unsafe rendering
- leaked secrets
- auth and session mistakes
- insecure client-side logic
- dependency risk

No fear-mongering. Just calm, precise threat modeling.

---

## ⚡ TurboSissy — Performance

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/turbo-sissy.jpg" alt="TurboSissy" />

Performance reviews are about **what scales badly** before it hurts.

Checks include:

- unnecessary re-renders
- misuse of `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
- data fetching waterfalls
- bundle bloat
- Core Web Vitals impact

If it slows users or burns CPUs quietly, TurboSissy notices.

---

## 🌐 Canonical Sissy — SEO

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/canonical-sissy.jpg" alt="Canonical Sissy" />

SEO here means **technical crawlability**, not marketing fluff.

This agent checks:

- server-side rendering of content
- meta tags and canonical URLs
- heading hierarchy
- hidden content
- international & RTL correctness

If Google can’t see it, it doesn’t exist.

---

## 🎨 ChicSissy — Styling & Design Systems

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/chic-sissy.jpg" alt="ChicSissy" />

This is where design systems stop being optional.

Focus:

- Tailwind discipline
- DaisyUI correctness
- RTL safety (no left/right crimes)
- spacing consistency
- contrast and touch targets

It enforces **visual consistency as engineering hygiene**, not taste.

---

## 🧹 KISS Sissy — Code Quality

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/kiss-sissy.jpg" alt="KISS Sissy" />

Readability is a feature.

This agent hunts:

- bloated functions
- unclear naming
- deep nesting
- DRY violations
- speculative abstractions

If future-you would sigh reading this code, KISS Sissy already did.

---

## ⚛️ Hooked Sissy — React

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/hooked-sissy.jpg" alt="Hooked Sissy" />

React reviews that actually understand React.

It checks:

- Server vs Client Component boundaries
- hook correctness
- state colocation
- effect misuse
- component responsibility

No cargo-cult patterns. No unnecessary `use client`.

---

## 📝 Unknown Sissy — TypeScript

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/unknown-sissy.jpg" alt="Unknown Sissy" />

TypeScript isn’t for vibes.

This agent flags:

- `any`
- unsafe assertions
- missing null handling
- sloppy generics
- bad type boundaries

It pushes toward **type-driven design**, not annotation theater.

---

## 📚 Detached-HEAD Sissy — Git & PR Hygiene

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/detached-head-sissy.jpg" alt="Detached-HEAD Sissy" />

This agent lives in your commit history.

It reviews:

- commit messages
- branch naming
- PR size
- missing Jira references
- accidental file changes

Clean history is a long-term asset.

---

## ✅ BugSlayer Sissy — QA & Requirements

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/bugslayer-sissy.jpg" alt="BugSlayer Sissy" />

This agent asks the uncomfortable question:

> “Did we actually build what was requested?”

It:

- maps code to Jira requirements
- finds edge cases
- generates test checklists
- flags scope creep

Code can be elegant and still wrong. BugSlayer keeps receipts.

---

## 🎭 Puppet Master — The Orchestrator

<img src="/images/blog/sissy/puppet-master-sissy.jpg" alt="Puppet Master" />

The Puppet Master doesn’t review code.

It:

- parses MR metadata
- runs architecture discovery
- spawns enabled agents
- collects results
- posts the final verdict

Think of it as **a conductor, not a judge**.

---

## Why This Works

Claude Code’s review system succeeds because it is:

- **opinionated** (standards are explicit)
- **modular** (agents can be enabled/disabled)
- **parallel** (fast, focused feedback)
- **context-aware** (architecture discovery first)
- **actionable** (every comment suggests a fix)

It doesn’t replace humans.  
It **raises the floor** so humans can focus on judgment instead of janitorial work.

---

## Closing Thought

Good code review isn’t about catching mistakes.  
It’s about **teaching the codebase how to stay healthy**.

The Sissies don’t nag.  
They document expectations—relentlessly.

And that, quietly, is how teams level up.
