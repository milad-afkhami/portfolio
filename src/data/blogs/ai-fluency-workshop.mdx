## What is AI Fluency?

AI fluency means going beyond just asking ChatGPT a question. It’s about giving context-rich prompts, iterating across chats, equipping AI with the right tools (like web search or MCPs), and chaining outputs into solutions.

## Why AI Fluency Is the Skill of the Decade

Think back to when computer knowledge became a baseline requirement in tech. The same is happening now with **AI Fluency** but at warp speed. Within the next 5-6 years, the ability to write clear, effective AI prompts will be **a default line item on job descriptions across every industry**, not just tech.

Most people **use** AI, but few are actually **fluent** in it. Just like typing numbers into Google Sheets isn’t the same as knowing formulas and pivot tables, asking ChatGPT for an answer isn’t the same as leveraging it fluently.

- _Non-fluent_: “Write me a cover letter.”
- _Fluent_: “Here’s my CV and the job description. Tailor a cover letter, highlight my career transition, draft three variations, and ask me clarifying questions.”

This workshop is about moving you from **user** to **fluent professional**.

Those who master AI Fluency will not just survive, they'll lead. Those who don't? They'll fall behind or be replaced by more AI-savvy professionals, regardless of title or seniority.

{/* In fact, senior experts are the least AI-proficient professionals because of their outdated habits. And that's exactly where the job displacement is starting because of high salary and less output. */}

## Learn to Think Like an Aligner, Not a Resistor

In this new AI-powered world, there are four types of professionals:

1. **The Ignorant**: These individuals completely disregard AI's impact, convinced that "nothing is happening". Let them be, they will eventually find out the hard way.
2. **The Resistors to Change**: You might recall online petitions against AI use, some even suggest providing incorrect answers to LLMs in order to prevent job displacement. This, to me, is a clear "cry for help" and they will eventually end up like the ignorant group.
3. **The Force-Fitters**: This group attempts to cram AI into their existing structures, perhaps achieving a modest 30-40% performance boost. For example, using a coding app like Cursor to implement the exact same code signature they already have in their project, reducing AI's accuracy and efficiency although they can give up on some low importance metrics.
4. **The Aligners**: My personal belief is that AI is a train that is already moving, and the best thing we can do is to get on board and leverage its trajectory. Instead of forcing AI into your current team structures and expecting a 20-30% improvement, you should identify where AI is heading and align yourselves with that path (jump on the train).

This workshop is designed to help you become an **Aligner**, someone who doesn't just _use_ AI, but evolves with it.

## From Software to Business, This Is for Everyone

Whether you're a developer, marketer, product manager, designer, or even part of HR, this workshop is **specifically designed for cross-functional teams**. Why? Because AI doesn't care about department boundaries.

Think of it like the early days of computers:

- Someone who only typed documents vs. someone who automated workflows in Excel.
- A worker with endless “final_v3” files vs. one who used Git to track versions effortlessly.
- An office user clicking through menus vs. one who flew with keyboard shortcuts.

AI fluency is the same kind of multiplier—only faster.

I've crafted many final assignments for the workshop to showcase how AI can immediately boost productivity in your role:

- Development: Generate an onboarding AI chatbot with RAG and a vector database and embed projects' information in it
- Product: Automate market research and writing endless documents like PRDs, release notes, and more
- Marketing: Streamline social & SEO content creation with AI workflows
- Data: Build internal chatbots for teammates for no-code data analysis
- HR: Use AI for automating repetitive tasks like onboarding & offboarding processes, digital signatures, and more
- Customer Support: Automate repetitive tasks like support tickets, writing help center docs and FAQs, and more
- And many more …

This isn't theoretical. You'll be solving real problems you face every day, only faster, smarter, and more consistently.

## Forget Old Trade-offs, AI Has Changed the Rules

Before AI, our engineering teams made decisions based on micro-optimizations: DX scores, learning curves, 0.01% speed gains. Today, our **most important tool-evaluation metric** is this:

> “How well does AI understand and work with this tool?”

Maintainability & Scalability? Still important, but not like before. With AI, code can be rewritten or improved in hours. Decision-making has shifted toward **how AI-friendly** a tool or process is. That's a mindset you'll adopt by the end of this workshop, and it will future-proof your skills.

## Not Just Learning, You'll Be Doing

Here's what makes this workshop different from typical courses or video playlists:

- **Interactive, hands-on structure** over 4 weeks
- **Check-in sessions** with peer collaboration
- Carefully curated curriculum and resources
- Build and complete a real-world, AI-driven project
- Access to expert-curated tools and prompt templates
- **Immediate results** see performance boosts _this month_

You're not expected to passively consume knowledge. You're here to **apply, build, automate, and iterate.**

## You Don't Need to Be a Developer, But You Must Be Curious

The only real prerequisites are:

- Intermediate English writing and listening (B1 level, IELTS 5+)
- Basic familiarity with tech terms like terminal, API, frontend, and backend

If you're not from a technical background, that's okay. The workshop includes foundational resources and mentorship to help you catch up fast.

## Certificate of Completion

Upon completion of the workshop, you will receive a certificate of completion like this:
