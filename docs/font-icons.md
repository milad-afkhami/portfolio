# Font Icons

## Tool

I use the [icomoon] website to generate font icons.

![icomoon import project](/public/images/docs/icomoon.png)

## Import

To import and edit font icons, upload the [selection.json] file into the icomoon web app and then try to upgrade icons.

## Upgrading

To edit icons, first import icons, then try to modify the icons in the select tab.

After you were done with modifications, upgrade the version of font icons based on the scale of your changes.

Download the zip file and extract it inside fonts/icons directory and replace it with all the existing files.
