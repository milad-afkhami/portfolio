**Helpers – Guideline**

Helpers are used to extract and organize business logic that is **specific to the current project**. Their purpose is to keep components clean and focused by offloading complex or repetitive logic into modular, reusable units.

> ✅ **Use Helpers** to isolate logic that is too domain-specific to belong in a shared utility library but too complex or repetitive to live directly in a component.
> ❌ **Do not use Helpers** for generic utility functions that could apply across multiple projects—those belong in shared libraries or utils directory.

**Example:**

```ts
export default class SomethingHelper {
  // Private instance property
  private privatePropertyExample;

  // Public instance property
  public publicPropertyExample;

  // Public static method
  public static publicMethodExample() {}

  // Private static method
  private static privateMethodExample() {}

  // Static getter
  public static get getterMethodExample() {}

  // Static setter
  public static set setterMethodExample(value) {}
}
```
